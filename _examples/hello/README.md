# Hello World

This example is meant to act as a simple proof of concept and has the bare minimum
needed to showcase a distributed GraphQL API. Since there is no need for any custom
logic, this example relies on the gateway cli to run.

This example has 2 services. Service A owns the fields `Query.allUsers` and `User.firstName`.
Service B owns the field `User.lastName`. To see the system work you can send the following query
to the gateway:

```graphql
{
  allUsers {
    firstName
    lastName
  }
}
```

## Running the Example

- Start both services by running `go run <filename>` in 2 separate terminals.
- Start the gateway over those 2 services: `gateway start --services http://localhost:8080,http://localhost:8081`
